# LeetCode Diary - C++ Problem Solving Repository

A comprehensive C++ problem-solving repository documenting algorithmic patterns, data structures, and systematic approaches to competitive programming and technical interviews.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Pattern Recognition**: Document and master core algorithmic patterns (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DP, etc.)
- **Systematic Learning**: Follow 80/20 DSA strategy focusing on high-impact problems
- **Progress Tracking**: Record attempts, time spent, and learning milestones
- **Template Library**: Maintain reusable C++ templates and code snippets
- **Visualization**: Create diagrams and visualizations for complex algorithms

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### Adding a Solved Problem

1. Use the problem template: `templates/problem-readme-template.md`
2. Create a new folder: `problems/XXXX-problem-name/`
3. Include: `readme.md`, `solution.cpp`, `metrics.yml`
4. Update your progress tracking CSV

### Learning Methodology

- **Sprint-based Learning**: 60-minute focused sessions
- **Pattern-first Approach**: Group problems by algorithmic patterns
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Easy → Medium → Hard within each pattern
- **Documentation**: Record insights, alternative approaches, and common mistakes

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Track your learning journey with:
- **Attempts**: Number of tries per problem
- **Time Log**: Sprint duration and phases (learn/implement/review)
- **Pattern Mastery**: Checklist for each algorithmic pattern
- **Company Frequency**: Problems tagged by company (Google, Microsoft, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- **Language**: C++ (C++17/20)
- **Data Processing**: Python scripts for CSV analysis
- **Visualization**: Chart.js/D3.js for web app, Matplotlib for static charts
- **Testing**: GitHub Actions for automated testing

## 📈 Key Metrics

- **Pattern Frequency**: Which patterns appear most in interviews
- **Time Analysis**: Learning curve and efficiency improvements
- **Mastery Checklist**: Track completion of core concepts
- **Company Patterns**: Understand different company preferences
