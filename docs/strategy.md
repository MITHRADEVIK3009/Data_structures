# 80/20 DSA Learning Strategy

## Core Philosophy

The 80/20 principle applied to Data Structures and Algorithms: **80% of interview success comes from mastering 20% of the most important patterns and concepts**.

## Weekly Learning Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- **Arrays & Strings**: Basic operations, two-pointers, sliding window
- **Hash Maps**: Frequency counting, complement searching
- **Basic Sorting**: Merge sort, quick sort concepts

### Phase 2: Core Patterns (Weeks 3-6)
- **Two Pointers**: Left-right, fast-slow pointers
- **Sliding Window**: Fixed and variable window problems
- **Binary Search**: Search space reduction
- **Stack & Queue**: LIFO/FIFO operations, monotonic stacks

### Phase 3: Advanced Patterns (Weeks 7-10)
- **Dynamic Programming**: 1D and 2D DP patterns
- **Tree Traversals**: DFS, BFS, recursive patterns
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, shortest paths
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimization problems

### Phase 4: Mastery (Weeks 11-12)
- **Complex DP**: State machines, interval DP
- **Advanced Trees**: BST operations, tree construction
- **Graph Advanced**: MST, topological sort, strongly connected components

## Sprint Methodology

### 60-Minute Sprint Structure
1. **Learning Phase (20 min)**: Read problem, understand constraints, identify pattern
2. **Implementation Phase (30 min)**: Code solution, handle edge cases
3. **Review Phase (10 min)**: Analyze complexity, consider optimizations

### Progress Tracking
- Record each sprint with: date, duration, phase, progress level
- Track patterns: which patterns you've mastered vs. need practice
- Time analysis: identify bottlenecks in your problem-solving process

## Pattern Priority Matrix

### High Priority (Must Master)
1. **Two Pointers** - Array manipulation, palindrome checking
2. **Sliding Window** - Substring/subarray problems
3. **Hash Map** - Frequency counting, complement searching
4. **Binary Search** - Search space reduction
5. **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems

### Medium Priority (Important)
1. **Stack/Queue** - Expression evaluation, BFS/DFS
2. **Tree Traversals** - Recursive and iterative approaches
3. **Graph BFS/DFS** - Connected components, shortest paths
4. **Greedy** - Optimization with local choices

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Advanced DP** - Complex state machines
2. **Segment Trees** - Range queries
3. **Union-Find** - Connected components
4. **String Algorithms** - KMP, Z-algorithm

## Weekly Review Process

### Sunday Review
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Which patterns did you practice this week?
2. **Time Tracking**: How much time did you spend on each pattern?
3. **Progress Assessment**: Which patterns need more practice?
4. **Next Week Planning**: Focus areas for the upcoming week

### Monthly Assessment
1. **Pattern Mastery**: Complete the mastery checklist
2. **Problem Count**: How many problems did you solve?
3. **Time Efficiency**: Are you getting faster at pattern recognition?
4. **Weak Areas**: Which patterns need more attention?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Pattern Confusion**: Don't mix up similar patterns (two pointers vs. sliding window)
2. **Over-optimization**: Focus on correctness first, then optimize
3. **Skipping Basics**: Master easy problems before moving to hard ones
4. **No Review**: Always review your solutions and learn from mistakes
5. **Time Pressure**: Don't rush through problems; understanding is more important than speed

## Success Metrics

- **Pattern Recognition**: < 2 minutes to identify the right pattern
- **Implementation Speed**: < 20 minutes for medium problems
- **Accuracy**: > 90% first-attempt success rate on easy problems
- **Consistency**: Daily practice, even if just 30 minutes
- **Documentation**: Complete problem notes for future reference
